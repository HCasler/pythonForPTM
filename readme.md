# Python for PTM

This is a collection of scripts I put together over the course of doing Offline simulations of protons on target, and looking at the production target monitor (PTM). The purpose of these is to facilitate making plots of simulated wire signals, proton counts, etc, in batches for groups of data sets with minimal effort. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: because these are utility scripts I wrote for myself and my own work, some of them expect to be working with data generated by my own fork of the Offline code, where I moved the production target virtual detectors to a location more convenient for my studies. That version of Offline is here: https://github.com/HCasler/Offline/tree/forTargetScans
I made an effort to comment the python code in the situations where this comes up.

Included here is:

### ChainAssembler.py
Takes a directory that can contain root files, and/or other directories which contain root files. Assumes a root file name starts with "nts." and ends with ".root". Creates a TChain based on the NTuple it is given.

### PTMReader.py
Contains several classes that take TChains and use them to create histograms. **PTMDetectorReader** makes plots based on the PTM sensitive detectors and **VirtDetReader** makes plots based on virtual detectors. 

### PTMPlotMaker.py
Imports the previous two and uses them to make and save plots I commonly had to make when looking at the results of my simulations. 

### examples.py
A few demonstrations of how to use these classes
